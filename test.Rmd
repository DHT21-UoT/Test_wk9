## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


# TESTING MARKUP FORMATTING


This is *italic*

This is **bold**

Let's try ***three stars***

Here I have some `r mean(c(2,3,4))` here

# Header1

## Header2

### Header3

I have a list

* first item
* next item

I have an ordered list

1. item

### Manual pipe table (must end with a blank line)


| Plant | Temp. | Growth |
|:------|:-----:|-------:|
| A     | 20    | 0.65   |
| B     | 20    | 0.95   |
| C     | 20    | 0.15   |



| Plant | Temp. | Growth |
|-------|-------|--------|
| A     | 20    | 0.65   |
| B     | 20    | 0.95   |
| C     | 20    | 0.15   |


## CARS

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

The data set has `r nrow(cars)` rows

```{r cars, results='markup'}
summary(cars)
```


### Testing some stuff
pretty table with kable

```{r cars2, results='asis', eval=F, echo=F}
knitr::kable(cars)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
